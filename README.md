# Esh (Êƒ) 

A programming friendly Ruby/shell mashup with a syntax suitable for both executing shell tasks and writing functions.

### Reasoning:

- We're tired of switching back and forth between repls and shells for common tasks.

- Ruby, because it is a popular modern language, and its Perl influence makes it compatible with many existing Unix shell conventions.

- Not pure Ruby, because a shell should support our shared muscle memory for things like `cd ..`

### Ruby on OS X is compiled against a fake readline library.  

If you're on OS X, everything will be better if you do one of these things:

#### If you use rvm:

    $ brew install readline
    $ rvm install 1.8.7 -C --with-readline-dir=/opt/local/

#### If you don't use rvm:

### Examples:

    $ 1+2
    3
    $ ls
    README esh.rb
    $ x = "."
    $ ls #{x}
    README esh.rb
    $ ls | split("\n").size
    2
    $ [1,2,3]
    [1, 2, 3]
    $ ['a', 'b', 'c'].join("\n")
    "a\nb\nc"
    $ puts ['a', 'b', 'c'].join("\n")
    a
    b
    c
    $ ['a', 'b', 'c'].join("\n") | wc
